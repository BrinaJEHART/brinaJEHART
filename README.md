## Brina Jehart

Hi there! I'm Brina and I'm a student at the University of Ljubljana [FRI](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en). I enjoy web development and I love creating short films ðŸŽ¥. I was firstly introduced to HTML in 2017 and it's only when I met CSS and JavaScript that I fell in love with web design and development. The fact that I can create anything I desire on a website is just so fascinating to me. I then moved from web developing onto some C# programming, but most recently I branched out and started working with python.
